# How to run project

## Development

### First

Run command "npm run watch". This command will allow tailwind classes to compile into css/main.css

### Second

Start project and enjoy coding. We can also use live server to start project

## For Production

Run command "npm run build" instead of "npm run watch". Because tailwind classes that we are using, are already compiled into css/main.css
